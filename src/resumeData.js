Throughout his time in our course, Martin proved himself to be a hard-working, motivated, ambitious,  and reliable teammate. His honesty, dependability, confidence, and excellent communication skills helped him become a sought after developer for our projects and challenges.  Martin is quick to help out wherever he is needed. Our fellow cohorts also hold Martin in the highest regard, not just because he’s a great person but also because he takes a proactive role in recognizing pain points but actively finding and implementing solutions for them. While Martin’s experience as a developer is limited at the moment, I have no doubt that he will continue to make a positive impact on any team that is fortunate enough to have him.  He’s a talented developer with a desire to learn and grow.  I truly hope that I will have the opportunity and honor to work again with him in the future.",
